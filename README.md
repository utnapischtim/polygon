# Welcome to Polygon

This software is split into two parts. Primary it was the intent to implement a
client version to display and visualize the building of a polygon and to
implement the calculation of the polygon in a server application. The focus shifted
from the visualization part to implement many algorithms. Therefore only the
server part is under active development for the moment. It is not excluded that
the client will be implemented in the future.

Therefore for further information please go to the server directory.
